# DONATIONS #

I love to code, that's essentially why I do it. But I also take good care of the community suggestions, and try to listen as much as possible to all the feedback in order to improve the application. Like you and the majority of the world I have bills to pay, and if you can afford to provide a token of appreciation via donation it would greatly help me get by. So if you do, here's how you can help me:
